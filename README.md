# FuelBox: a Fuel-based Automation Tool

In recent years, Fuel becomes one of the mainstream installers for OpenStack distributions. FuelBox is a fuel-based command line tool to provide a full-automated solution for various tests and large-scale development on multiple target platforms.

This tool can be used for testing & deployment purposes like provisioning VM/physical environment, launching a Fuel master server, deploying OpenStack and validating Cloud functions. It supports KVM and VirtualBox based virtual machines and IPMI-based physical servers on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

FuelBox streamlines and accelerates time-consuming, often complex, and error-prone process of developing, testing and deploying various configurable profiles of OpenStack environments at scale.
